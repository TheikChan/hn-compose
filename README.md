# Hacker News Compose

Learn about the basics of [Jetpack Compose](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jetpack+compose&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) by building a Hacker News client. Built to demonstrate a UI built on Compose with a simple [backend API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

This app is a companion to a talk/course about getting started with Jetpack Compose. It contains the final project as well as the beginning/intermediary steps to complete the project.

## Getting Started

There is some pre-work for this session to get up and started. This course expects you to have a development machine that can run Android Studio (preferably a Mac) and can clone stuff using (public) GitHub. A network connection is also required.

1. Download [Android Studio **Canary**, 4.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview)
1. In Android Studio 4.2, use the AVD Manager to [create an Android emulated device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd). Use API 29 or later.
1. Fork this repository to your own username on GitHub
1. Clone your fork

You can test out the basic starting point by opening the `start` directory in Android Studio.
