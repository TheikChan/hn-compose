# Hacker News Compose

Learn about the basics of [Jetpack Compose](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jetpack+compose&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) by building a Hacker News client. Built to demonstrate a UI built on Compose with a simple [backend API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

This app is a companion to a talk/course about getting started with Jetpack Compose. It contains the final project as well as the beginning/intermediary steps to complete the project. If you're interested in the material presented in the talk, check out the [keynote](keynote) folder.

## Getting Started

1. Download [Android Studio **Canary**, 4.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview)
1. In Android Studio 4.2, use the AVD Manager to [create an Android emulated device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd). Use API 29 or later.
1. Fork this repository to your own username on GitHub (so you can pull my last minute changes)
1. Clone your fork

You can test out the basic starting point by opening the `start` directory in Android Studio and running it in your newly-created emulator. Each subsequent module is the final state of a given module in the original presentation - but nicely act as touchstones along the development path to the fully-featured app.
