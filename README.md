# Hacker News Compose

Learn about the basics of [Jetpack Compose](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jetpack+compose&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) by building a Hacker News client. Built to demonstrate a UI built on Compose with a simple [backend API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

This app is a companion to a talk/course about getting started with Jetpack Compose. It contains the final project as well as the beginning/intermediary steps to complete the project.

## Getting Started

There is some pre-work for this session to get up and started. This course expects you to have a development machine that can run Android Studio (preferably a Mac) and can clone stuff using (public) GitHub - *I recommend your personal device if possible*.

1. Download [Android Studio **Canary**, 4.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview)
1. In Android Studio 4.2, use the AVD Manager to [create an Android emulated device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd). Use API 29 or later.
1. Fork this repository to your own username on GitHub (so you can pull my last minute changes)
1. Clone your fork

You can test out the basic starting point by opening the `start` directory in Android Studio and running it in your newly-created emulator.

## Help

If you need help with setting up your project prior to the session (July 9, 2020) feel free to drop an [Issue](https://github.com/robotsquidward/hn-compose/issues) in this project using the **question** Label. Or just hit me up on Teams.
